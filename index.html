    <h3> Le Prive World Cuisine </h3>
    <p>I absolutely adore Le Prive World Cuisine for its exceptional blend of diverse flavors and culinary expertise.
        <b>The menu offers diverse foreign cuisines such as Indian, Italian, Indo-Chinese, Thai, Mexican, and
            Mediterranean.</b> The restaurant also has a variety of sweets on its menu created in-house. The restaurant
